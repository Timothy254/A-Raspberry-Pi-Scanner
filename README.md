# A-Raspberry-Pi-Scanner
The rapid development of computer network system brings both a great convenience and new security threats for users. Network security problem generally includes network system security and data security. Specifically, it refers to the reliability of network system, confidentiality, integrity and availability of data information in the system. Network security problem exists through all the layers of the computer network, and the network security objective is to maintain the confidentiality, authenticity, integrity, dependability, availability and audit-ability of the network.  Network scanning and vulnerability testing relies on tools and processes to scan the network and its devices for vulnerabilities. This aids in refining any organization's security policy due to identification of vulnerabilities, and guarantees that the security measures taken actually gives the protection that the organization expects and requires. Administrator needs to perform vulnerability scan periodically which helps them to uncover shortcomings of network security that can lead to device or information being compromised or destroyed by exploits. In this project we make use of the portability feature of a Raspberry Pi and configure it as a Network Scanner using Kismet Tool to be able to scan networks wherever possible given the permission.
